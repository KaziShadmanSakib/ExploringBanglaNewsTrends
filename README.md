# ExploringBanglaNewsTrends

Conducted an in-depth analysis of the Daily Star Bangla news portal, aiming to gain
insights into the most frequent topics discussed over a span of seven days.
Leveraging the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique, performed topic modeling
on three distinct datasets: daily news, peak user hour news (9 PM - 11 PM), and
off-peak user hour news (4 AM - 6 AM). Additionally, merged the data from all seven
days to perform topic modeling on a weekly basis.
